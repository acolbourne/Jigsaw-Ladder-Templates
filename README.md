# Jigsaw Daytradr Ladder/DOM Templates
I've made my basic Jigsaw ladder template public. You can use this as a basis for configuring your own DOMs. This XML file contains the exact configuration that I use, along with a basic colour set which can be modified to your needs. Personally, I use different colours for each market/correlation block and this is the approach I recommend that you follow.

# Installation
Copy and paste the XML file into C:\Users\\{Your Username}\Documents\Jigsaw Trading\Templates\DepthSales, or into the Templates\DepthSales folder of your Jigsaw Daytradr installation if your path is different.
